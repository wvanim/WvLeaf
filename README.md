**GitHub Summary: Display Management Tree Technical Specification**

---

### **Overview**  
A hierarchical system for managing display elements through alternating **time (Pieces)** and **space (Groups)** control, ensuring determinism, scalability, and performance. Designed for complex UIs/animations with strict rules and optimizations.

---

### **Core Components**  
1. **Piece**  
   - Manages timelines and tracks (visual, audio, Z-order).  
   - Operates in isolation, processing data at time `t` and sleeping between keyframes.  
   - Synchronizes via *synchro-pieces* for coordinated timelines.  

2. **Face**  
   - Terminal render unit (**Face-leaf**) or container (**Group**).  
   - Types: Images, text, clickable zones, or nested Groups.  

3. **Group**  
   - Spatial organizer for Pieces.  
   - Supports 2D/3D transformations and specialized logic (e.g., articulations).  

---

### **Key Rules**  
- **Strict Alternation**: `Piece → Group → Piece → Face-leaf`.  
- **No Reuse**: Unique instances prevent state conflicts.  
- **Determinism**: Global state predictable from internal data. Perturbations (e.g., manual overrides) require explicit resynchronization.  

---

### **Tracks & Transitions**  
- **Types**: Visual, Z-order, mouse actions, audio, business logic.  
- **Activation Modes**:  
  - **Continuous** (e.g., fade-in) affects until next keyframe.  
  - **Instant** (e.g., sound effect) triggers once.  
- **Transition Control**: Dedicated tracks manage predefined effects (fade, slide) with priority over base timelines.  

---

### **Optimizations**  
1. **Fusion**: Merge a Piece with its single Face/Group to reduce hierarchy.  
2. **Parallelization**: Thread-safe processing via instance uniqueness and immutability.  
3. **Complexity Metric**: Adaptive scoring to trigger optimizations (e.g., track simplification).  
4. **Matrix Precalculation**: Vectorization and caching for fast spatial transforms.  

---

### **Performance**  
- **Latency**: ~0.02 ms for 1k active Pieces (optimized, parallelized).  
- **Scalability**: Inactive branches sleep, minimizing resource use.  
- **Comparison**: Outperforms Unity/React in theoretical benchmarks.  

---

### **Architecture Highlights**  
- **Fixed Faces**: Immutable after creation, ensuring stability.  
- **Isolated Face-Leaves**: Handle events locally, decoupled from spatial hierarchy.  
- **OO Groups**: Extensible 2D/3D spatial logic without impacting render layers.  

---

### **Use Cases**  
- **UI Systems**: Menus, interactive elements.  
- **Animations**: Character rigs, transitions.  
- **Data Visualization**: 3D projections, real-time updates.
